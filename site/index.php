    <p>Welcome to the <strong>FlyingHinges</strong> website! I've had a number of
      nicknames over the years including (comparatively recently) Captain Flying
      Carpet. Well Flying Hinges is Captain Flying Carpet's repository of
      almost all the crazy stuff he's been into over the years. (What sort of nutter
      talks about themself in the third person I wonder?!)</p>
    <p>I have divided the site into the sections detailed below.
      Feel free to explore and if there&rsquo;s anything you can&rsquo;t
      find or understand - get in touch!</p>
