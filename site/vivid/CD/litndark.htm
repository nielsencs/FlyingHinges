<BR>Whenever I see your face, It makes me want to cry

<BR>To see you in such disgrace - they spit in your eye.

<BR>It's impossibly rude, don't they know who you are?

<BR>How can they be so crude, you're the bright morning star.

<BR>

<BR>'Who do you say I am?' 'The Light in the dark'

<BR>Kindle in me a flame that burns from a spark

<BR>

<BR>Who is that foreign man they've taken from the crowd?

<BR>Strong enough to help the one who's lying on the ground.

<BR>It seems so far away when you think of today.

<BR>Now the world cries in pain, dying to get out of the rain.

<BR>

<BR>'Who do you say I am?' 'The Light in the dark'

<BR>Kindle in me a flame that burns from a spark

<BR>

<BR>So roll back your hearts tomb and find the body gone

<BR>Flee from the backdraft when feelings are strong

<BR>Find out what you've been given It's a bright brand new path

<BR>A break from tradition - escape from the wrath

<BR>

<BR>'Who do you say I am?' 'The Light in the dark'

<BR>Kindle in me a flame that burns from a spark
