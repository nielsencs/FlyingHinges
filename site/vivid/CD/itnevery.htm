<H1><FONT COLOR=CC00CC>It Could Never Be You</FONT></H1>



<BR>Hounded by the takers, no time for the givers

<BR>Who shine the light that matters

<BR>Will I ever find the man I should be;

<BR>That I should be?

<BR>

<BR>The road plays much harder now and the weary faces

<BR>Grow in numbers, surrounding me

<BR>Drowning in a yearning that says "give me peace -

<BR>Where is the peace?"

<BR>

<BR>But it could never be you dear,

<BR>Because you're the steady rock

<BR>Even as the waves crash.

<BR>And Lord it could never be you because

<BR>This filthy mind and flesh

<BR>Are made perfect In Your Light.

<BR>

<BR>Does anybody know 

<BR>the place where they're running to

<BR>Catch a slow train

<BR>Talk for hours

<BR>Test the changes

<BR>To find where we stand

<BR>But where do we stand?

<BR>

<BR>But it could never be you dear,

<BR>Because you're the steady rock

<BR>Even as the waves crash.

<BR>And Lord it could never be you because

<BR>This filthy mind and flesh

<BR>Are made perfect In Your Light.
