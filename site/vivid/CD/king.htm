<BR>Can a river flow away?  Can a flood dry in a 

<BR>day?  Can a love just fade away?

<BR>I don't know but even so - broken promises shattered

<BR>dreams You tore my heart at the seams all the clichés rule supreme

<BR>

<BR>King Cliché rules again

<BR>

<BR>It seems it's cliché time again. You won the battle I failed your

<BR>test.  Why do I still think you're the best?

<BR>The crime's committed - the judgement made There doesn't seem so much to

<BR>say.  My love's too crude too well displayed.  All the clichés rule today

<BR>

<BR>King Cliché rules again

<BR>

<BR>Can a river flow away?  Can a flood dry in a 

<BR>day?  Can a love just fade away?

<BR>I don't know but even so - broken promises shattered

<BR>dreams You tore my heart at the seams all the clichés rule supreme

<BR>

<BR>King Cliché rules again
