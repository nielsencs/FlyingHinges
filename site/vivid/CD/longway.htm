<BR>You and me and the love we share

<BR>Has given up the need to dare

<BR>Comfortably living in the past

<BR>Viewing all our dreams that didn't last

<BR>

<BR>Long way home

<BR>Far away from here

<BR>Oh, but I love you

<BR>I really love you, dear

<BR>

<BR>Why don't we break the force of habit

<BR>And give ourselves a chance

<BR>I see you daydreaming so much these days

<BR>Across a cluttered kitchen glance

<BR>

<BR>Long way home

<BR>Far away from here

<BR>Oh, but I love you

<BR>I really love you, dear

<BR>

<BR>A new horizon, miles from here

<BR>Is calling very loud

<BR>A place where our love was found

<BR>Your glowing eyes I saw across the crowd

<BR>

<BR>Long way home

<BR>Far away from here

<BR>Oh, but I love you

<BR>I really love you, dear

<BR>

<BR>There is a place where eagles fly

<BR>Within our hearts and minds

<BR>A bond of love so strong through our affliction

<BR>And hope - our benefit in kind

<BR>

<BR>Long way home

<BR>Far away from here

<BR>Oh, but I love you

<BR>I really love you, dear
