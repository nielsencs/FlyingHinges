<H1><FONT COLOR=CC00CC>Another Song</FONT></H1>



<BR>Sitting here rocking chair

<BR>Rigid in a stone suit

<BR>But it represents the most of me

<BR>Paralised emotionally

<BR>

<BR>Come on now, renegade heart

<BR>Smash this granite stone apart

<BR>The lies have sat with me too long

<BR>Time to sing another song...

<BR>

<BR>Another song, we must be strong, time to right another wrong

<BR>Another day to find a way, time to pray for more to say

<BR>Another song we must be strong, time to write another song

<BR>

<BR>Swallowed up in my cup

<BR>all alone for want of you

<BR>Loneliness, like the coffee

<BR>Is as cold as cold as stone

<BR>

<BR>Another song, we must be strong, time to right another wrong

<BR>Another day to find a way, time to pray for more to say

<BR>Another song we must be strong, time to write another song
