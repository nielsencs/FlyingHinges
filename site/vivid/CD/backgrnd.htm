They're a four-piece specialising in a unique style of music which Carl calls (with a wry smile on his face!) Techno-Folk.

Probably more commonly reffered to as Acoustic Rock.  Not that they're afraid to use technology (electric guitars, synthesisers,

drum machines, sequencers etc. - hence the techno bit, I guess).

Originally formed by the song writing partnership of Carl Nielsen and Kevin Purdy late 1994, they have concentrated less on live performance

than on crafting their debut album, '<A HREF="kissfrow.htm">Kiss The Frown</A>'.

</P>

<P>

Having been around a bit, Carl and Kevin were both determined not to have their work undermined by a band that had any unnecessary friction in it.

They knew that the solid relationship they had would provide a firm foundation and it was while they were looking for the right studio and production values that

Phil came into the frame in the Summer of 1996.  During recording, they felt the need for female vocals on some of the tracks and Juliette was prepared to lay

aside some of the work she was currently doing to provide them.

</P>

<P>

The partnership has worked extremely well and recording has been completed, with the 'final' mix of every track 'exactly' the way they all want it! (more or less).

Artwork is currently being put together and a release date is expected soon.
