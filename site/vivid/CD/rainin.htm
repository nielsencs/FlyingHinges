<BR>Shouting...through the walls again

<BR>Hostile words generating hatred

<BR>They'll be smilling 'lovey-dovey' when tomorrow comes

<BR>And I'll be left tired and restless once again.

<BR>

<BR>I'm searching for the rain in sunny waterfalls

<BR>I'm looking for a pocket full of peace

<BR>Perhaps I'll find an island where the angels call

<BR>And cast away the enemies in me.

<BR>

<BR>The riotous gang go charging up the street

<BR>Looting, breaking glass for ther so-called 'just cause'

<BR>She's ninety-one today as she trembles behind the curtain

<BR>She's anybody's mother maybe mine or yours

<BR>

<BR>She's searching for the rain in sunny waterfalls

<BR>She's wishing for a thimble full of peace

<BR>Her ageing years will one day set her body free

<BR>She meets her maker, founder of her life.

<BR>

<BR>The creaking vessel rocking on the waves

<BR>The safest they have been for many years

<BR>I guess it's their Bounty, mutiny on the land

<BR>A chance to drift away from endless tears.

<BR>

<BR>They're searching for the rain in sunny waterfalls

<BR>Trying to find a country full of peace

<BR>They'll search in vain to find a brand new paradise

<BR>Always seem to be the misfit refugees.
