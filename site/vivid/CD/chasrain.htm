<H1><FONT COLOR=CC00CC>Chasing Rainbows</FONT></H1>



<BR>Chasing rainbows is all that they say,

<BR>But they don't know what's coming our way

<BR>Chasing rainbows is all that they say.

<BR>

<BR>Keep the strings moving, strumming away

<BR>And we'll pen the language of our hearts

<BR>Calming a fever of hope all the way

<BR>We know where we've been and we know where to start

<BR>

<BR>Chasing rainbows is all that they say,

<BR>But they don't know what's coming our way

<BR>Chasing rainbows is all that they say.

<BR>

<BR>Blinded by the stresses of this west world

<BR>Tears for many people in the east

<BR>We must make the right decisions in our new World

<BR>The flour of life together with the yeast

<BR>

<BR>Chasing rainbows is all that they say,

<BR>But they don't know what's coming our way

<BR>Chasing rainbows is all that they say.

<BR>

<BR>A pipedream we had is no longer a stranger

<BR>Day after day a bit more peace of mind

<BR>Oh sure you can come along and slam my face with danger

<BR>At least we know what we want to find
