<BR>I've Gone through days being a child

<BR>Now I'm getting older

<BR>Life rolls along from day-to-day

<BR>I'm sure it's getting colder

<BR>

<BR>Warm breeze I'm pretty sure you're out there

<BR>My heart's gone and spilled the beans

<BR>Set me free

<BR>Plant a seed

<BR>

<BR>Kiss the face on the frown

<BR>Come and Kiss the face on the frown

<BR>

<BR>I've come to pay and count the cost

<BR>Got me feeling like an alien

<BR>And gaze at all the things I've lost

<BR>now the futures there for saving

<BR>

<BR>Warm breeze I'm pretty sure you're out there

<BR>My heart's gone and spilled the beans

<BR>Set me free

<BR>Plant a seed

<BR>

<BR>Kiss the face on the frown

<BR>Come and Kiss the face on the frown

<BR>

<BR>I never thought you'd walk in my room

<BR>A distant cry of a living lie

<BR>A loving word anguish overturned

<BR>

<BR>Kiss the face on the frown

<BR>Come and Kiss the face on the frown
