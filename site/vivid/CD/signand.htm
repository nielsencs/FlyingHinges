<H1><FONT COLOR=CC00CC>The sign and the Seal</FONT></H1>



<BR>I see the faces in the barroom

<BR>Not sure where they're going

<BR>Couldn't be sure of where they've been

<BR>What of my face, what does it say?

<BR>Does it recognise the truth, does it know the way

<BR>

<BR>Enhancing and living the sign and the seal

<BR>Awaken today for all you reveal

<BR>

<BR>The sun goes down outside the window

<BR>The red sky surrenders to the night

<BR>Another day  ends to be pardoned

<BR>The world ever turning - someone else's first light

<BR>

<BR>Enhancing and living the sign and the seal

<BR>Awaken today for all you reveal

<BR>

<BR>As for your life, I'm caught by the essence

<BR>I cannot run, consumed in the silence

<BR>A moment so dear, confirms my renewal

<BR>Forever and living, the sign and the seal

<BR>

<BR>Enhancing and living the sign and the seal

<BR>Awaken today for all you reveal
