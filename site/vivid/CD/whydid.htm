<H1><FONT COLOR=CC00CC>Why Did You Leave Me?</FONT></H1>



<BR>The scene surrounds me once again

<BR>Now time is on my hands

<BR>Your footprints marked the sinless landscape

<BR>One blemish on the land

<BR>

<BR>Softly, Suddenly, but so clear

<BR>

<BR>Why did you leave me standing in the snow?

<BR>Why did you leave me?  I'll never, never ever know

<BR>Why did you leave me waiting at the door?

<BR>Why did you leave me?  And are you really sure?

<BR>

<BR>But I have known a happy home

<BR>She's loved me through the years

<BR>Cold Warmth inside when you do not love

<BR>You hide the lying inner tears

<BR>

<BR>Kindly, lovingly ,but nowhere near

<BR>

<BR>Why did you leave me standing in the snow?

<BR>Why did you leave me?  I'll never, never ever know

<BR>Why did you leave me waiting at the door?

<BR>Why did you leave me?  And are you really sure?

<BR>

<BR>The snow thaws - I see my sorrow in utter desolation

<BR>Oscar, were you right to say it's better to love and lose than to never love at all?

<BR>

<BR>Why did you leave me standing in the snow?

<BR>Why did you leave me?  I'll never, never ever know

<BR>Why did you leave me waiting at the door?

<BR>Why did you leave me?  And are you really sure?
