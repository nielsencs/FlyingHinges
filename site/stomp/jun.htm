June is when holidays start - Carl was away sunning himself in Portugal for TWO WHOLE WEEKS!!!  Does he have no
commitment?  Doesn't he realise we've got no time at all to complete the robot?!  Actually, we were able to get on
with the job much better in his absence and completely rebuilt the 'turning foot'</p>

One of Carl's neighbours (yet another one!) offers us some paint - red, black and silver.  STOMPs colour scheme may have just been
