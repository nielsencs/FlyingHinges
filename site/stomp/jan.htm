Carl had been watching Robot wars for two years now and still felt he could do with a team of the right people
do better than most competitors so far seen on telly.  He sent off for the required membership and started
asking friends and colleagues if they were interested in forming a team.  Seven people expressed an interest.
</p>
<p>
An initial meeting was organised and the seven invited.  Only four turned up and although others expressed interest at
various times, those four, with Carl are the STOMP team.
</p>
<h2>Stomp First Meeting</h2>
<p>
After a lively brainstorm we decided to take the
following direction:

<li>To have FUN!</li>
<li>To try to get on the television programme in 1999 (design has to be complete by May?)</li>
<li>To entertain</li>
</ul>

Simon volunteered to look after the money
</p>
<p>
Carl made it clear that it was his team and any disputes will be decided by him (what a git!).  He also announced
that the three people who will be on the programme (assuming we get that far) will be Carl + the two best pilots.
</p>
<p>
Everyone who's interested may join in, and do not necessarily have to assist in construction, but will have to pay all
subs.
</p>
<p>
Initial sub of &#163;10 was agreed.  Additional funds as required (and when everyone can afford it!).
</p>
<p>
The following ideas were examined:
</p>
<center><img src="images/img00001.gif"></center>
<p>
We looked at a number of two and three wheeled designs, especially with really large wheels to scramble over everyone
else.  Then there was the topple-tolerant 4 wheel idea where the wheels stick out front and rear (and top &amp; bottom),
giving traction in a variety of tricky spots).  And finally the crazy option - the walker.
</p>
<p>
We felt that we'd like to do a walker if we can, because it is the most dramatic looking, and most challenging.
 The big challenges with the walker are steering and speed.  It was generally felt that if we do some small
experimental models with Lego, Meccano etc.  We could work out some of the feasibility of the project and if
unworkable we could revert to one of our earlier ideas.
