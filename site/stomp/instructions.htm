<h1>Stomp - Animator - version 0.2</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Stomp Animator comprises a simple maze, Stomp and some control buttons.&nbsp;
It allows the user to experience the handling characterists of the Stomp
robot!</p>

<h2>System Requirements</h2>
<p>The Stomp Animator has been written in Java using JDK 1.2 but should work
with JVM 1.1.4 and upwards.&nbsp; It has been tested with the following
browsers:</p>
<br>&nbsp;
<table width="64%" bgcolor="#000099">
<tr>
<td>Netscape Navigator 4.61</td>

<td>NT 4.0</td>
</tr>

<tr bgcolor="#0000CC">
<td>Internet Explorer 5</td>

<td>NT 4.0</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Internet Explorer 4</td>

<td>Windows 95</td>
</tr>

<tr bgcolor="#0000CC">
<td>Internet Explorer 3</td>

<td>Windows 95</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>
Running The Animator</h2>
At the bottom of the screen is a set of buttons and a scroll bar which
allows Stomp to be controlled.&nbsp; The following table summarizes the
controls:
<br>&nbsp;
<table width="64%" bgcolor="#000099">
<tr>
<td>Restart</td>

<td>Restarts the Stomp game</td>
</tr>

<tr bgcolor="#0000CC">
<td>Stop</td>

<td>Stops Stomp</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Left</td>

<td>Turns Stomp left</td>
</tr>

<tr bgcolor="#0000CC">
<td>Right</td>

<td>Turns Stomp right</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Forward</td>

<td>Makes Stomp go forward</td>
</tr>

<tr bgcolor="#0000CC">
<td>Reverse</td>

<td>Makes Stomp go backward</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>"scroll bar"</td>

<td>Controls speed</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The idea of the animator is simply to navigate Stomp around the maze.&nbsp;
If Stomp hits the side of the maze then Stomp will stop.&nbsp; Stomp should
also stop automatically if the Stomp page is replaced with another.&nbsp;
Remember that turning left or right is relative to the direction in which
Stomp is facing.&nbsp; There are, however, no visual cues to indicate which
direction Stomp is facing.&nbsp; By increasing the speed Stomp can be made
to move at different speeds - where slow (and stop) can be thought of as
realistic and fast is in the realms of fantasy!
<p>Having read the above have a go!
<h2>
Bugs and "Features"</h2>

<ul>
<li>
Turning left or right only works when Stomp is moving.</li>

<li>
Turning, in general, is a "bit sudden".</li>
</ul>

<h2>
Possible Future Improvements</h2>
The following are subject to time, motivation and inclination:
<ul>
<li>
Add a "cost" feature whereby Stomp expends energy when doing something.&nbsp;
After expending too much energy stomp would stop.</li>

<li>
Introduce a timer which would allow trips around the maze to be timed.</li>

<li>
Introduce textured background and maze elements.</li>

<li>
Introduce hazards (possibly animated) that effect Stomp in some way.&nbsp;
For example, the fire pit.</li>

<li>
Replace buttons with control box look-alike graphics.</li>
</ul>
